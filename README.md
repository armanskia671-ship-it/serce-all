# Serce All Project Structure

The Serce All project is organized into several subfolders, each containing distinct components or microservices:

1. **artur**: This folder contains the code and resources related to the Artur project.
   
2. **serce1**: This subfolder hosts the Serce1 application, a crucial part of the overall architecture.

3. **serce**: Inside the Serce folder, you will find the main codebase for the Serce microservice.
   
4. **aplikacja**: This directory is designated for the Aplikacja application, which integrates with other modules.
   
5. **ogloszenia**: The Ogloszenia folder contains resources and code managing advertisements within the system.
   
6. **wolowimiecie**: Finally, this folder includes the Wolowimiecie project, which is another vital component of the Serce All system.

Each of these subfolders follows best practices for organization, enabling streamlined development and maintenance.
